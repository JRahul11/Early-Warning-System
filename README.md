# Traveller's Early Warning system

Background: Frequent travellers suffering from various medical conditions find
it difficult to keep watch on their medical routine and either miss dosages, or are
unaware of the threats that a destination weather can pose to them. We want to
help them with a web application that displays the weather conditions of the desired location
and helps them to keep track of their medications while travelling via SMS/Email.

1. Weather analytics will be based on:
    a. Temperature
    b. Minimum Temperature
    c. Maximum Temperature
    d. Humidity
    e. Weather Group
    f. Weather Description
    g. Wind Speed
    h. AQI
    
2. Pill dosage reminder via Email.
